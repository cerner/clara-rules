  "Shred the given rules into separate conditions, allowing for analysis, 
   combination of duplicate logic, and assembly into a rule base.

   This function breaks up productions into distinct pieces. Specifically:
  
   First, we have a tree of beta nodes. The beta side of a Rete network (ignoring the alpha side for now)
   is logically a tree, with shared logic represented as shared branches on the tree.
   We model that here by having each condition from all of the rules map to a
   \"condition key\", and that key is used as a node in our beta tree. So if multiple
   rules have a common condition in a common point in a tree, they map to the same
   place and therefore the logic is shared, in line with the Rete algorithm.

   The \"beta-tree\" produced by this shredding logic is modeled as a series of
   nested maps, where the key to each nested map is the condition-key described above.
   The leaves in our beta tree are the production rules or queries themselves.

   Second, we maintain a map of the condition keys used in the beta tree to the conditions
   themselves. If multiple rules have equivalent conditions, they will have
   the same condition key, and hence will map to the same point of our conditions
   map so the same item and alpha node will be used for both.

   This shredding operation also preserves the rules and queries provided by the
   caller. This is useful if a consumer wants to get back to the original rules
   for some other use, such as combining them with others to create a new
   knowledge base."
